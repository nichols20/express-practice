With the config npm package we are able to store configuration settings based on the
environment stage. keywords development & production .json allow use to store complex
objects that equal specific values we set. For example if I wanted the name of the 
application to be set to one value in the development stage however change that once
the app is ready to be put on production I can attribute those values in each individual
file and the code will return the values set depending on whatever I set the environment
stage to.


*SENSITIVE DATA SHOULD NOT BE STORED IN THESE CONFIGURATION FILES EX. PASSWORD TO DATABASE
OR PASSWORD TO MAIL SERVER ETC. DATA LIKE THAT SHOULD BE STORED IN ENVIRONMENT VARS
THEN READ THEM IN A CONFIG FILE. IN THESE FILES WE ONLY ATTRIBUTE THE OBJECT NAMES
NOT THE VALUES THEMSELVES SEE CUSTOM-ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES.JSON FILE FOR EXAMPLE.
